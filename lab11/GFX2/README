The files in this directory are:
================================

  newfunctions2.txt :  a listing of the new function prototypes

  gfx2.h :  the new header file for those functions
            (those new functions and their descriptions are after line 50)

  gfx2.o :      the new .o compiled file
  gfx2_mac.o :  the new .o compiled file for the mac (to run natively)

  testgfx2.c :  simple program to test some of the basic new functions

  testpoly.c :  program to test the new drawing functions (polygon, ellipse, arc, etc.)
                and to test the 'filled' versions of some of them
                also shows how to set up an array of XPoint points for the polygon

  testcursors.c :  program to test a few new cursors (mouse pointers)

  testfont.c :  simple program to test using a font

  testxstructs.c :  simple program to test some of Xlib's structs (see below)


Here are some of the available struct's that are part of Xlib
  (they are already included, so no need to do any extra includes; they're only shown here
    so that you know what they're called and what their members' names are))
    (note that "short" means "short int")

typedef struct {
    short x, y;
} XPoint;

typedef struct {
    short x1, y1, x2, y2;
} XSegment;

typedef struct {
    short x, y;
    unsigned short width, height;
} XRectangle;
